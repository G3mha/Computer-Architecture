Objective: **Sine Wave Generator with Quarter-Cycle Symmetry**

## Circuit Design

This circuit generates a sinusoidal waveform through a 10-bit R-2R ladder DAC using quarter-cycle symmetry to reduce memory from 512 to 128 samples (first quarter cycle). The physical circuit is implemented on a breadboard, as shown in the image below:
